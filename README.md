**🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python in Google Colab. The goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends in the data to understand factors that may have influenced passenger survival.

**📂 Dataset**

Name: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)

File Used: train.csv

Description: Contains passenger details such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

**🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used**

Python

Pandas → Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib → Data visualization

Seaborn → Advanced visualizations

Google Colab → Cloud-based Python execution environment

**🔍 EDA Steps Performed**

Data Loading & Inspection

.head(), .info(), .describe()

Checking missing values

Data Cleaning

Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)

Correcting data types

Exploratory Visualizations

Univariate Analysis: Histograms, Countplots

Bivariate Analysis: Survival rate by gender, class, and age

Multivariate Analysis: Pairplots, heatmaps for correlation

Statistical Insights

Survival rate analysis

Class & gender effect on survival

Age distribution trends

**📊 Key Visuals**

Passenger age distribution histogram

Survival rate by passenger class & gender

Heatmap of feature correlations

Boxplots for fare distribution

**📈 Summary of Findings**

Gender: Women had a significantly higher survival rate.

Class: Higher-class passengers had better chances of survival.

Age: Younger passengers tended to survive more often.

Fare: Higher fares were linked to higher survival probability.

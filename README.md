**🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python in Google Colab. The goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends in the data to understand factors that may have influenced passenger survival.

**📂 Dataset**

- **Name**: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)

- **File Used**: train.csv

- **Description**: Contains passenger details such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

**🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used**

- **Python**

- **Pandas** → Data manipulation and analysis

- **Matplotlib** → Data visualization

- **Seaborn** → Advanced visualizations

- **Google Colab** → Cloud-based Python execution environment

**🔍 EDA Steps Performed**

1. Data Loading & Inspection

   - .head(), .info(), .describe()

   -  Checking missing values

2. Data Cleaning

   - Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)

   - Correcting data types

3. Exploratory Visualizations

   - **Univariate Analysis**: Histograms, Countplots

   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Survival rate by gender, class, and age

    - **Multivariate Analysis**: Pairplots, heatmaps for correlation

4. Statistical Insights

   - Survival rate analysis

   - Class & gender effect on survival

   - Age distribution trends

**📊 Key Visuals**

- Passenger age distribution histogram

- Survival rate by passenger class & gender

- Heatmap of feature correlations

- Boxplots for fare distribution

**📈 Summary of Findings**

- **Gender**: Women had a significantly higher survival rate.

- **Class**: Higher-class passengers had better chances of survival.

- **Age**: Younger passengers tended to survive more often.

- **Fare**: Higher fares were linked to higher survival probability.
